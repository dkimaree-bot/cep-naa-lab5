# JALAPENO POPPERS RECIPE

## INGREDIENTS
 - 12 jalapeno peppers
 - 1 cup thick whole milk greek yogurt
 - ¼ cup grated cheddar cheese
 - 3 tablespoons chives, divided
 - 2 garlic cloves, grated
 - ½ teaspoon onion powder
 - ½ heaping teaspoon sea salt, more for sprinkling
 - ⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika
 - 6 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
 - Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling

## INSTRUCTIONS
 - Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
 - Slice the jalapeños in half and remove the seeds and ribbing. Note: You might want to use rubber or disposable plastic gloves when working with these spicy peppers.
 - In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, cheese, 2 tablespoons of the chives, garlic, onion powder, salt, and smoked paprika, if using. Fill the jalapeño halves with the yogurt mixture, sprinkle with panko, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the topping is golden brown. Remove from the oven and garnish with the remaining chives.

## NOTES
 - Not all Yogurt thicknesses are the same.Some brands of yogurt are thicker than others. For this recipe (since we're trying to replicate cream cheese) use thick yogurt such as FAGE, Chobani, or the Trader's Joe brand.
- Grate the cheese using the small holes on a box grater.
