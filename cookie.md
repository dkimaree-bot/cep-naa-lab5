# INGREDIENTS

 - **Butter**: This white chocolate macadamia nut cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter. 

 - **Sugars**: You’ll need a blend of white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe. 

 - **Eggs**: Eggs act as a binding ingredient, which means they hold the dough together.

 - **Extracts**: Add flavor with vanilla extract and almond extract. 

 - **Flour**:  All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.

 - **Baking powder**: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.

 - **Mix-ins**: Of course, you’ll need coarsely chopped white chocolate chips and coarsely chopped macadamia nuts!
